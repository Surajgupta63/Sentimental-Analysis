Overview:
This project demonstrates how to classify text data into sentiments (positive, negative, or neutral) using TF-IDF vectorization and a Naive Bayes classifier. The goal is to provide a simple and effective framework for sentiment analysis that can be applied to various datasets.

Features:
TF-IDF Vectorizer: Converts textual data into numerical format for machine learning.
Naive Bayes Algorithm: A probabilistic classifier known for its speed and effectiveness in text-based tasks.
Accuracy Evaluation: Metrics and visualizations to assess model performance.
Easy Customization: Modify or expand the pipeline for your specific use case.
